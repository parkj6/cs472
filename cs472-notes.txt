The Computer Revolution
	Progress in Computer Technology
		underpinned by Moore's Law
	Makes novel applications feasable
		cars, cellphones, human genome project, www, search engines
	Computer are pervasive
	
Classes of computers
	Personal Computers
	Servers
	Supercomputers
	Embedded
	Personal Mobile Devices (PMD)
	Cloud computing
		Warehouse Scale Computers (WSC)
		Software as a Service (SaaS)
	
	Shift to RISC architecture is because of cost of RAM is cheaper and it's faster than CISC
		
Understanding Performance
	Algorithm 
		Determines number of operations executed
	Programming Language, compiler, architecture
		Determines number of machine instructions executed per operations.
	Processor and memory system
		Determine how fast instructions are executed.
	I/O system (hardware and OS)
		Determines how fast I/O operations are executed.
		
8 Great Ideas
	1. Moore's Law (Design)
		Intel's tic-tok approach
	2. Abstraction (Simplify Design)
		multi-threaded cores
	3. Common Case Fast
	4. Parallelism (Performance)
		single-core isn't a thing anymore
	5. Pipelining (Performance)
		Conveyer Belt Pizza
	6. Prediction (Performance)
		CPU starts executing codes before the results are made becuase it predicted the result.
	7. Hierarchy (of memories)
		register - RAM - SSD in that order
		caching systems.
	8. Dependability (redundancy)
		ECC memory (have more than it says it have)

Inside the Processor

Abstractions
	Abstractions help with complexity
		Hide Lower-level detail
	Instruction set architecture (ISA)
		The hardware/software interface.
	Application binary interface (ABI)
		
		
Technology Trends - Relative performance / cost
	1951 Vacuum Tube 					- 1
	1965 Transistor (Switch)			- 35
	1975 Integrated Circuit (IC) 		- 900
	1995 Very large scale IC (VLSI) 	- 2.4M
	2013 Ultra large Scale IC			- 250B

Items to consider
	Response Time
	Throughput
		total work done per unit time
	How are respone time and throughput affected by:
		Replacing or adding more processors
		
Relative Performance
	Define Performance = 1/Execution Time
	"X is n times faster than Y"
	
	
	
Measuring Execution Time
	Elapsed Time
		Total Response time, including all espects
		Determines system performance
	CPU Time	Time spent processing a given time.
	

CPU Clocking
	Operation of digital hardware governed by a constant-rate clock
		(rising edge, falling edge)
	* Clock period: duration of a clock cycle
		"How much time do i have to finish before the next cycle starts"
		e.g. 250ps = 0.25ns = 250 x 10^-12s
	* Clock frequency (rate): Cycles per Second
		e.g. 4.0GHz = 4000MHz = 4.0 x 10 ^9 Hz
	CPU Time = CPU Clock Cycles x Clock Cycle Time
			 = CPU Clock Cycles / Clock Rate
	Improve Performance by:
		Reducing number of clock cycles
		Increasing clock rate
	Clock Cycles = Instruction Count x Cycles per Instruction
	CPU Time = Instruciton Count x CPI x Clock Cycle Time
			 = Instruciton Count x CPI / Clock Rate
	Instruction Count for a Programming	
		Determined by programm ISA and compiler
			 
		
	
Performance Summary
	CPU Time = Instructions/Program * Clock cycles/Instruction * Seconds/Clock cycle
	
	Performance depends on (all affects IC):
		Algorithm: affects IC, possibly CPI
		Programming language: affects IC, CPI
		Compiler: affects IC, possibly CPI
		Instruciton set architecture: IC, CPI, Tc

"Hot spots on todayâ€™s processors can reach power densities of 1 kilowatt per square centimeter, much higher than the heat inside a rocket nozzle." - https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/four-new-ways-to-chill-computer-chips
	
	
Multiprocessors
	- Multicore microprocessors
	- Requires explicitly parallel programming
	
	
Pitfall: Amdahl's Law
	Improving an aspect of computer and expecting a proportional improvement in overall performance.
	
	T_(improved) = T_(affected) / (Improvement factor) + T_(unaffected)

example: multiply accounts for 80s/100s
		how much improvement in multiply performance to get 5x overall?
		
		20 = 80/n + 20 (impossible)

Fallacy: Low Power at Idle		
	Example: i7 power benchmark
		100% load: 258W
		50% load: 170W (66%)
		10% load: 121W (47%)
	example: Google data center
		mostly operates at 10% and 50% load
		1% of the time: 100%
	consider designing processors to proportional to power load. 
	
MIPS: Million of Instruciton Per Second
	Doesn't account for the differences between:
		ISAs between computers
		complexity between instructions.

Instruction Set
	- Different computers with different instruction sets with many aspects in common. 
	- Early computer: simpler instruction sets (simplified)
	
The MIPS Instruction Set
	Standford MIPS commercialized by MIPS technologies
	Large share of embedded core
	Typical of many modern ISAs
		MIPS Referance data card, Appendix B,E
	32 registers
	
		
Arithmetic Operation
	Add and subtract 3 operands
	Dest, src, src,
	ADD a, b, c #a gets b+c
	
	
	"simplicity favors regularity"

C code:
	f = (g + h) - (i +j);
MIPS:
	add t0, $s1, $s2 # temp t0 = g + h
	##add t0, g, h # temp t0 = g + h
	add t1, i, j # temp t1 = i + j
	sub f, t0, t1 # f = t0 - t1
	
Register Operands:
	Arithmetic instructions use register operands
	MIPS has a 32 * 32-bit register file
		- used for freq used data (0-31)
		- 32bit data called a "word"
	Assembler names
		$t0, $t1, ..., $t9 for temp values
		$s0, $s0, ..., $s for saved variables
	
Memory Operands:
	Main memory used for composite data
		Arrays, structures, dynamic data
	To apply arithmetic operations:
		load values from mem -> register
		store reg -> memory
	memory is byte addressed 
		each address identifies an 8bit byte
	words are aligned in memory
		address must be a multiple of 4
	MIPS is BIG Endian
		Big E: Most-significant byte at least address of a word
			Bytes:	|A|B|C|D|
			Addr:	 1 2 3 4
		Little E: least-significant byte at least address. 
			Bytes: 	|D|C|B|A|
			Addr:	 1 2 3 4 

Memory Operands example:
	c code:
		A[12] = h + A[8]
		g in $s1, 
		h in $s2
		base address of A in $s3
	MIPS:
		#Index 8 requires offset of 32
		lw $t0, 32($s3) 	#load word 32=offset
		add $s1, $s2, $t0
		sw $t0, 48($s3)		#store word 48=offset
	
	
Registers vs. Memory
	Registers are faster to access
	Operating on memory data requires loads and stores
	Compiler must use registers for variable as much as possible
		Only spill to memory for less frequently used variable
		
Immediate Operands
	Constant data specified in an instruction
	
	addi $s3, $s3, 4		# add 4 to s3
	addi $s2, $s1, -1		# subtract 1 to s3
	
	Design Principle 3: make the common case fast
		small constants are common
		immediate operands avoids a load instruction.
		
Constant Zero
	MIPS register 0 ($zero) is the constant 0
		cannnot be overwritten
	Useful for common operations
		add  $t2, $s1, $zero # move between registers.
		
Unsigned Binary Integers:
	Range: -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1)-1
			-2,147,
	

	
2s-compliment Signed Integers
	Bit 31
	
in x86, it operates mem-reg because only 4 gen purpose registers exists (eax, ebx, ecx, edx)

Signed Negation
	Complement and add 1 (flip 0/1)
	x + ~x = -1
	

Assembler Pseudo instructions
	Most assembler instructions represent machine instructions 1:1
	
	move $t0, $t1 -> add $t0, $zero, $t1
	

	
	
Signed vs Unsigned
	signed comparison: slt, slti
	unsigned comparison: sltu, sltui
	example:
		$s0 = 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111
		$s1 = 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
		slt $t0, $s0, $s1 #signed
			-1 < +1 -> $t0=1
		sltu $t0, $s0, $s1 #unsigned

Assembly Review
	when you call a function, the variable is stored on register or on the stack.
	
	everything that access memory has to come from register (MIPS)

Non-Leaf Procedure 
	- Procedure that call other procedures.
	
	
Local Data on the Stack
	- Local data allocated by callee.
		e.g. C automatic variables.

Principle of Locality
	Programs access a small proportion of their address space at any time
	Temporal locality
		Items accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon.
		e.g. instructions in a loop, induction variables.
	Spatial locality
		Items NEAR  those accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon.
		borrowing a book from the library and related subject.
		e.g. sequential istruction access, arrar data.
		
	L1, L2, L3 cache
	

Taking Advantage of Locality

Memory Hierarchy Levels
	Block (aka line): unit of copying
	If accessed data is present in upper level
		Hit: access satisfied by upper level
	If accessed data is absent
		Miss: Block copied from lower level
			Time Taken: miss penalty
	Hit: accessed info successful. 
	Hit ratio: hits/accesses
	Miss Ratio: Misses / accesses = 1 - hit ratio

Memory Technology
	Static RAM (SRAM)
		SRAM is on the diode in the processor
		$2000 - $5000 /GB
		0.5ns - 2.5ns
		Keeps its value indefinitely (with power - volitile) 
	
	Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
		$6 - $25 /GB
		50ns - 70ns
		"Leaks" and must be refreshed (volitile)
		Data Stored as a charge in a capacitor
			Single transistor used to access the charge
			Must periodically be refreshed
				Read contents and write back
				Performed on a DRAM "row"
			4096 bits * 4096 bits in a single banks
			buffer between Act and Pre 
		ECC Memory (Error Control Checking)
	
	Magnetic disk
		$0.02 - $1.00 /GB
		5ms - 20ms
	
Advanced DRAM Organization
	Bits in a DRAM are organized as rectangular arrays

	Double Data Rate (DDR) DRAM
		Transfer (writing) on rising and falling clock edges. 
	Quad Data Rate (QDR) DRAM
		Separate DDR input and outputs.
	DDR4 speed > DDR3 speed. (1.2v vs 1.5v)


Disk Sectors and Access
	Each sector records
		Sector ID
		Data (512 bytes, 4096 bytes proposed)
		Error correcting code (ECC)
			used to hide defects and recording errors

Caching

Principle of Locality
	Programs access a small portion of their address space at any time
	Temporal locality
	Spatial locality
	
	
Disk Performance Issues
Manufactureers 

Cache Memory


Example: Larger Block Size (64 blocks, 16 bytes/block)
	To what block number does address 1200 map?
	Block address = 1200/16 (bytes/block) = 75
	Block number = 75 % 64 = 11
	
	31-10 Tag (22bits)
	9-4 Index (6bits)
	3-0 Offset (4bits)
	
Block Size Considerations
	Larger blocks should reduce miss rate (spatial locality)
	But in a fixed-sized cache
		Larger blocks => fewer of them (pollution)
			more competition => increased missed rate
	Larger miss penalty
		Can override the benefit of reduced miss rate
		Early restart and critical-word-first can help. 
		When you miss 2 block, only fetch 2 block. if you miss 16 block, need all 16.

	
Cache Misses
	On cache hit, CPU proceeds normally
	On cache miss
		Stall the CPU pipeline
		
Write-Through
	On data-write hit, could just update the block in cache (also update memory)
		But then cahce and memory would be inconsistenct
		Write takes longer (because of memory update)
		
Write-back (alternative to Write-Through)
	Alternative: on data-write hit, just update the block in cache
		keep track of whether each block is dirty
		
		
Write Allocation
	What should happen on a write miss?
	Alternatives for write-through
		Allocate on miss: fetch the block
		write around: don't fetch the block. 
			initialization writes a whole block before reading it. 
	For write-back
		usually fetch the block
	
	
	
Example: Intrinsity FastMATH
	Embedded MIPS processor
		12 stage pipeline
		Instructions and data access on each cycle
	Split cache: I-cache (instruction) D-cache (data)
		each 16KB: 256blocks * 16 words/block
		D-cache: write-through or write-back.
		Need more reads on I-cache than D-cache. 
	Mux = switch on which data to read out (32bit)
	
	
Main Memory Supporting Cache
	Use DRAMs for main Memory
		Fixed width (eg. 1 word)
		Connected by fixed-width clocked bus (usually slower than CPU clock)
	Example: clock block read
		1 bus cycle for address transfer
		15 bus cycle per DRAM access
		1 bus cycle per data transfer
		With 4-word block, 1-word-wide DRAM
			Miss penalty = 1 + 4*15 + 4x1 = 65 bus cycles
			Bandwidth = 16b / 65 cycles = 0.25 B/cycle
			
Measuring Cache performance
	CPU Time:
		Program execution cycle (includes cache hit time)
		Memory stall cycles (mostly cache misses)
		
Memory Stall cycles 
= (memory access / program) x miss rate x miss penalty
= (instructions / program) x (misses / instruction)	x miss penalty
	example:
	I-cache miss rate: 2%
	D-cache miss rate: 4%
	Miss penalty: 100 cycles
	Base CPI (ideal cache) = 2
	Load & stores: 36% of instructions
	
	I-cache misses: 0.02 x 100 = 2 cycles / instructions
	D-cache misses: 0.36 x 0.04 x 100 = 1.44 cycles / instructions
	Actual CPI = 2 (base) + 2 (I miss) + 1.44 (D miss) = 5.44
		Ideal CPU = 5.44/2 = 2.72 times faster. 
	
	
Associate Caches
	Fully Associative
		Allow a given block to go in any cache entry
		Requires all entries to be searched at once
		comparater per entry (expensive) 
	n-way set associative
		Each set contains n entries
		Block number determines which set
			(block number) % (# sets in cache)
			in 2 way, even data on set 0, odd data on set 1
		search all entries in a given set at once.
		n-comparitors (less expensive)
	
Direct mapped: #block 
Set associative: #blocks / n = #sets
Fully associate: #blocks / #blocks = all access @ same time.

Replacement Policy
	Direct Mapped: once and done. 
	Set Associative
		Perfer non-valid entry (if possible)
		or choose among entries in the set
	Least recently used (LRU)
		Choose 1 unused for the longest time.
			2-way: simple
			4-way: managable
			n>4-way: too complicated.
	Random
		Give approx

Virtual Memory
	CPU - Translation (need security but also speed) - physical mapping to memory or hdd.

Addresss Translation
	usually have fixed-sized pages (e.g. 4096b)
	Modern hardware could have 128Mb pages.
	every program has their own stack of heap (accessing other program = seg fault).
	
Avoid SWAP space as much as possible because it's slower than physical memory (only used as overflow once RAM is full)

Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement reduces page faults.
	Referance bit (use bit) in PTE set to 1 on access to page. 
	Periodically cleared to 0 by os when not used recently.
	
Writing disk is done in sectors.
	dirty bit in PTE set when page is written. 
	write back > write through
	
TLB (really fast cache, used to handle page table entries)
Translation Look-aside Buffer. 
	if page in memory,
		load from PTE and retry
		




Cashe Design Trade-offs. 

Increase Cache size:
	- Decrease capacity misses
	- May increase access time
Increase Associativity
	- Decrease conflict misses
	-

Five Stages of 
	1. IF: 	Instruction FETCH from memory
	2. ID: 	Instruction DECODE & register read
	3. EX: 	EXECUTE operation or calculate address
		ALU
	4. MEM: Access MEMORY operands
		RAM
	5. WB: 	WRITE result back to register.

example:
	Fetch 	-> Decode	-> Execute...
	10ns	-> 15ns		-> 50ns		= minimum 75ns (worst case - single-core).
	50ns	-> 50ns		-> 50ns 	

Pipeline Speedup
	If all stages are balanced:
		time between instructions (pipelined)
		= time between instructions (non-pipelined) / # of stages.
Pipeline and ISA Design
	All instructions are 32bits
		RISC > CISC
			CISC has (x86) 1 - 17-byte instructions. 
			But they dont always use it.
		easier to fetch and decode in one cycle.
	Few and regular
		
Pipeline Hazard
	Situation that prevent starting the next instruction in the next cycle.
	1. Structure
		A required resource is busy (w/r)
		Conflicts for use of a resource
		In MIPS pipeline with a single memory
			Load/store requires data access
			instruction fetch would have to stall for that cycle (pipeline "bubble")
	2. Data 
		Need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write.
		Intel's x86 can do out-of-order execution (a=b+c; d=a+e <- A is not ready yet. )

		Fix1: Forwarding (aka Bypassing)
			Use result when it is computed
				Dont wait for it to be register
				requires extra connections in the datapath.
				
		Load-Use Data Hazard
			Can't always avoid stalls by forwarding if value not computed when needed.
			load everything first, then do math.
	3. Control
		Deciding on control action depends on previous instruction.
		Branch determines flow of control
			fetching next instruction depends on branch outcome. 
			Pipline can't always fetch correct instruciton
				still working on ID stage of branch.
		In MIPS pipeline
			Need to compare registers and computer target early in the pipeline
			Add hardware to do it in ID stage. 




Pipeline registers
	Taking snapshots between stages that was taken before.
	half the clock cycle are write (shaded left) and half read (shaded right)
		rising (write), falling (read) edge



		
Branch Prediction
	Some Branch design gets 20+ prediction to optimize branches.
	Pipeline improve performance by increasing instruction throughput
		
2-bit predictor
	Only change prediction on two successive mispredictions.
	
slow & long || fast and faster clock cycle?
		
MESI coherence Protocol
	M: Modified
		No copies in other caches
		memory is stale
	E: Exclusive
		no copies in other caches
		memory is up-to-date
	S: Shared
		Un modified copies may exists
		memory is up-to-date
	I: Invalid		
		Not In Cache
		
		
blocking: pause on execution

	Process vs Thread
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Process:
	- Your program managed by the os
	- Personal address spsace
	- Can run on its own
	- Can havve multiple threads

Threads:
	- Subdivision of process.
	- share parts of the memory
	- Linux (Prossess = Thread), Windows (Threads)
	- has its own stack, registers, program counter

Concurrency:
	Working on multiple tasks
	"multiple tasks which start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, in no specific order."
	"dealing with lots of things at once."
	
	core0:  | A | B | A | B | A
			_____<- time spent on execution.	
				^ thread(A) reads a file
					^ file is now available.
	
Parallel Operation:
	Working on multiple tasks simultaneously.
	"multiple tasks OR several part of a unique task literally run at the same time, e.g. on a multi-core processor."
	"doing a lot of things at once."
	core0: | A | ...
	core1: | B | ...
		
Sharing informations across threads:
	- Sharing access is problematic
	- you need some way to indicate ownership
		- mutex (onep processes at a time) (let c++ take)
		- atomic reads or writes
		
		
	vector (c++ in final project)
